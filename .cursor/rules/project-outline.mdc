Project Name: VinoRecall
Type: Educational Web Application (SaaS) 
Core Methodology: Spaced Repetition System (SRS) - WaniKani Style
Subject Matter: Wine Education (Specifically WSET Level 1 & 2)

## 1. Executive Summary

VinoRecall is a visually immersive study platform designed to help wine students pass WSET Level 1 and Level 2 exams. Unlike traditional text-heavy study guides, VinoRecall uses a WaniKani-style Spaced Repetition System (SRS) to present high-quality visual flashcards. The platform uses objective correctness tracking for multiple-choice questions, automatically determining when cards should be reviewed based on answer accuracy.

## 2. Design Philosophy & UI/UX

The application prioritizes visual learning over text density. The interface should feel like a premium digital wine cellar—warm, inviting, and sophisticated.

**Visual Style:** Deep Burgundies (#561C24, #9E3B4D), Forest Greens (#2D3F2F), and Cream tones (#FFFBF2, #FFE9CC). High usage of photography (vineyards, bottles, grapes).

**Layout (Logged In):**

- **Horizontal Navigation Header:** Fixed burgundy navigation bar at top with logo, menu items, user dropdown
- **Hero Section:** Full-width background imagery with gradient overlay featuring enrolled deck cards
- **Main Canvas:** Scrollable, card-based interface with clean white sections on cream background
- **Mobile Responsive:** Collapsible hamburger menu, touch-optimized interactions

**Interaction:** Soft transitions, automatic correctness detection, satisfying visual feedback for correct/incorrect answers.

## 3. Content Scope (The Curriculum)

The app is divided into two distinct "Worlds" (Levels), based on the WSET syllabus.

**Level 1: The Foundation**
- Grape Identification: Visual cards showing grape clusters -> User identifies the grape (e.g., Merlot, Chardonnay)
- Tasting Technique: The "SAT" (Systematic Approach to Tasting). Identifying acid, tannin, and body
- Food & Wine: Basic pairing principles (e.g., Salt + Acid = Good)
- Service: Glassware types and serving temperatures

**Level 2: The Intermediate**
- Geography: Map-based cards. Show a highlighted region on a map -> User identifies the region (e.g., Bordeaux, Rioja)
- Label Terminology: Images of wine labels with blurred sections -> User identifies the missing term (e.g., "Grand Cru")
- Production: Diagrams of winemaking (Red vs. White vs. Rosé processes)
- Varietals in Depth: Linking regions to grapes (e.g., Marlborough -> Sauvignon Blanc)

## 4. Feature Breakdown

### A. The "Study Interface" (Core Feature)
This is the primary screen where the user spends 90% of their time.

**Flow:**
1. **The Prompt:** A card appears with an image or question
2. **Answer Selection:** For multiple-choice, user selects an answer
3. **Instant Feedback:** System automatically shows if answer is correct or incorrect
4. **Continue Button:** User proceeds to next card (Space/Enter hotkey)

**SRS Logic - WaniKani Style:**
- **Correct Answer:** Next review exponentially increases (1 day → 2.5 days → 6.25 days, etc.)
- **Incorrect Answer:** Review in 4 hours
- **Ease Factor:** Dynamically adjusts (increases +0.1 for correct, decreases -0.2 for incorrect)
- **Traditional Cards:** Default to correct (for non-multiple-choice content)

### B. The Dashboard - Hero Section
A visually rich overview of the user's "Wine Journey" with WaniKani-inspired layout.

**Hero Section:**
- Full-width vineyard background with gradient overlay
- Welcome message with user name and current streak
- **Featured Deck Cards (2-3 decks):**
  - Large card with deck image background
  - Due cards count prominently displayed
  - Retention rate percentage (correct answers ratio)
  - Progress bar (reviewed / total cards)
  - "Start Review" button

**Content Sections:**
- **Daily Goal:** Circular progress indicator showing cards reviewed today (target: 20 cards), weekly streak dots
- **Recent Mistakes:** List of incorrectly answered cards with timestamps, link to review mistakes
- **Recent Activity:** Timeline of recent reviews with correct/incorrect indicators (green checkmark / red X)
- **Available Decks:** Grid of decks not yet enrolled, with thumbnails and enroll buttons

### C. The Library (Deck Browser)
Users can browse and enroll in specific decks.

**Features:**
- Grid layout with deck thumbnails (uses default images 1.jpg - 10.jpg based on deck ID)
- Deck information: name, description, card count
- Enrollment system with unique shortcodes
- Filter by: Red Wines, White Wines, Regions, Production, Spirits (for L2)

### D. User Progression
**Metrics Tracked:**
- Cards Mastered: Total cards with high retention
- Current Streak: Consecutive days of study
- Retention Rate: Percentage of correct answers per deck
- Daily Reviews: Number of cards reviewed today

**Future:** Leveling System with badges (e.g., "Sommelier in Training", "Vintner") based on cards mastered.

## 5. Site Map

**1. Public Facing (Logged Out)**
- Landing Page: High-impact visuals, value proposition, "The Science of SRS," Pricing, Success Stories
- Auth Pages: Login / Register

**2. Application (Logged In)**
- **Dashboard:** Hero with deck cards, daily goal, mistakes, recent activity, available decks
- **Study Interface:** Distraction-free flashcard mode (navigation hidden)
- **Library:** Deck browser with enrollment
- **Deck Stats:** Detailed statistics per deck
- **Profile/Settings:** Subscription management, user preferences

## 6. Technical Architecture

### SRS Algorithm (WaniKani-Style)
The system uses **objective correctness tracking** rather than subjective difficulty ratings:

**Core Logic:**
- Multiple-choice cards: System compares selected answer with correct answer
- Correct → `is_correct = true`, rating = 'correct'
- Incorrect → `is_correct = false`, rating = 'incorrect'
- Traditional cards: Default to correct (for self-assessment content)

**Review Intervals:**
- **Incorrect:** 4 hours
- **Correct (First time):** 1 day
- **Correct (Subsequent):** Previous interval × ease_factor
- **Ease Factor:** Starts at 2.5, increases +0.1 for correct (max 3.0), decreases -0.2 for incorrect (min 1.3)

**Database Schema:**
- `card_reviews.rating`: 'correct' or 'incorrect'
- `card_reviews.is_correct`: boolean
- `card_reviews.selected_answer`: stores user's answer for multiple-choice
- `card_reviews.ease_factor`: dynamic difficulty adjustment
- `card_reviews.next_review_at`: calculated review time

### Deck Management
- **Enrollment System:** Each user-deck relationship has a unique 8-character shortcode
- **Image System:** Decks can have custom images or use default images (1.jpg - 10.jpg based on deck ID modulo 10)
- **DeckImageHelper:** Centralized helper for consistent image paths

### Navigation Architecture
- **Header-based Navigation:** Replaced sidebar with horizontal burgundy header
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile hamburger menu, collapsible on small screens
- **Study Mode:** Navigation hidden during review sessions for focus

### Repository Pattern
- **CardReviewRepository Methods:**
  - `getMistakes($userId, $limit)`: Recent incorrect answers
  - `getRetentionRate($userId, $deckId)`: Percentage of correct answers
  - `getDueCardsForUser($userId)`: Cards due for review
  - `getCurrentStreak($userId)`: Consecutive study days
- **DeckRepository Methods:**
  - `getAvailableDecks($userId)`: Decks not yet enrolled
  - `getUserEnrolledDecks($userId)`: User's active decks

### Frontend Components
- **Blade Components:** Header, hero sections, stat cards, deck cards
- **Livewire:** Dashboard, StudyInterface, Library (reactive components)
- **AlpineJS:** Dropdown menus, mobile navigation, interactive elements
- **TailwindCSS:** Utility-first styling with custom burgundy/cream theme

## 7. Image Optimization

**Visual First Approach:**
- High-quality photography for decks and cards
- Default image library (10 vineyard/wine images)
- Lazy loading for performance
- Background images with gradient overlays for readability

## 8. Mobile First

70% of users will study on their commute:
- Touch-optimized card interactions
- Responsive hero section (stacks on mobile)
- Hamburger navigation menu
- Large touch targets for buttons
- Space/Enter keyboard shortcuts for desktop power users

## 9. Key Differentiators from Anki

VinoRecall uses a **WaniKani-style approach** rather than Anki:
- **Objective vs Subjective:** System determines correctness automatically for multiple-choice
- **Simplified Ratings:** Only correct/incorrect (not again/hard/good/easy)
- **Visual First:** Hero dashboard with deck imagery
- **Retention Focus:** Emphasizes accuracy percentage over ease perception
- **Shorter Incorrect Intervals:** 4 hours (not 1 minute) for realistic re-learning
