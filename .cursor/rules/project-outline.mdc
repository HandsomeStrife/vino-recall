Project Name: VinoRecall
Type: Educational Web Application (SaaS) Core Methodology: Spaced Repetition System (SRS) Subject Matter: Wine Education (Specifically WSET Level 1 & 2)

1. Executive Summary
VinoRecall is a visually immersive study platform designed to help wine students pass WSET Level 1 and Level 2 exams. Unlike traditional text-heavy study guides, VinoRecall uses Spaced Repetition System (SRS) to present high-quality visual flashcards. The platform predicts when a user is about to forget a fact and serves that specific card to them, optimizing study time.

2. Design Philosophy & UI/UX
The application prioritizes visual learning over text density. The interface should feel like a premium digital wine cellar—warm, inviting, and sophisticated.

Visual Style: "Dark Mode" aesthetic using deep Burgundies, Forest Greens, and Cream text. High usage of photography (vineyards, bottles, grapes).

Layout (Logged In):

Left Sidebar: Fixed navigation pane (collapsible on mobile).

Main Canvas: A scrollable, card-based interface on the right.

Interaction: Soft transitions, "flipping" card animations, and satisfying "completion" indicators.

3. Content Scope (The Curriculum)
The app is divided into two distinct "Worlds" (Levels), based on the WSET syllabus.

Level 1: The Foundation
Grape Identification: Visual cards showing a grape cluster -> User identifies the grape (e.g., Merlot, Chardonnay).

Tasting Technique: The "SAT" (Systematic Approach to Tasting). Identifying acid, tannin, and body.

Food & Wine: Basic pairing principles (e.g., Salt + Acid = Good).

Service: Glassware types and serving temperatures.

Level 2: The Intermediate
Geography: Map-based cards. Show a highlighted region on a map -> User identifies the region (e.g., Bordeaux, Rioja).

Label Terminology: Images of wine labels with blurred sections -> User identifies the missing term (e.g., "Grand Cru").

Production: Diagrams of winemaking (Red vs. White vs. Rosé processes).

Varietals in Depth: Linking regions to grapes (e.g., Marlborough -> Sauvignon Blanc).

4. Feature Breakdown
A. The "Study Gym" (Core Feature)
This is the primary screen where the user spends 90% of their time.

The Prompt: A card appears with an image or a short question (e.g., "What region is highlighted?").

The Reveal: User clicks "Reveal Answer." The card flips or expands.

The Rating: The user self-assesses how easy it was:

Again (Forgot) -> Show in 1 minute.

Hard -> Show in 1 day.

Good -> Show in 3 days.

Easy -> Show in 7 days.

B. The Dashboard
A visual overview of the user's "Wine Journey."

Daily Goal: "Review 20 Cards."

Streak Counter: Number of consecutive days studied.

Mastery Heatmap: A visual representation (perhaps a cluster of grapes filling up) showing how much of the syllabus has been mastered.

C. The Library (Deck Browser)
Users can browse specific decks if they want to "cram" a specific topic outside of the algorithm.

Filter by: Red Wines, White Wines, Regions, Production, Spirits (for L2).

D. User Progression
Leveling System: Users earn badges (e.g., "Sommelier in Training", "Vintner") based on cards mastered.

5. Site Map
1. Public Facing (Logged Out)

Landing Page: High-impact visuals, value proposition, "The Science of SRS," Pricing, Success Stories.

Auth Pages: Login / Register.

2. Application (Logged In)

Dashboard: Stats, Streaks, "Due Today."

Study Interface: The distraction-free flashcard mode.

Decks/Library: Overview of all available card packs.

Profile/Settings: Subscription management, daily card limits.

6. Technical Logic (High Level)
The Algorithm: The backend must run a logic script every night (or upon request) that checks: When did the user last see this card? What did they rate it? Is it due today?

Image Optimization: Because this is a "Visual Representation" site, the system needs to serve high-quality images that load instantly (Lazy loading).

Mobile First: 70% of users will study on their commute. The flashcard interface must work perfectly on a phone screen.
